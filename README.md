# Short-term memory trainer

This little cute application was designed to help you train your Short-term memory capabilities.

# What does it do?

Based on chosen difficulty, it generates a string of characters for you to memorize, then prompts you to enter them, awarding you with some sweet points to your score.

Difficulty defines how many characters there are in the string and if the string is a valid English word.

Good luck!

And remember, "With great memory comes great satisfaction from your own intellect".
